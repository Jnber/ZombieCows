Prolog zombie cows game
The principle of the game is very simple: 
  Dimitri got lost in an alp. Night falls and for warm up, Dimitri goes into the middle of a herd of cows. Suddenly, one of them dies strangely and stands up: itâ€™s a zombie cow! The player plays Dimitri who has to run away of the herd without being bitten by a zombie cow.
  
  To move dimitrie chooses nord, sud, est , ouest or reste (to stay in place).
  With every move a cow randomly moves and zombie cows bite their neighbors.
  
  Good luch player!
